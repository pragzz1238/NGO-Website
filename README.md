# NGO Website

This is a responsive NGO website created during my first year of development using HTML and CSS. The website is designed to showcase the activities and mission of the NGO.

## Features

- Responsive Design: The website is designed to be accessible and user-friendly on various screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

- Information Sections: The website includes sections that provide information about the NGO's mission, activities, and contact details.

- Demo Video: A demo video (`ngo website.mp4`) has been included to showcase the functionality and appearance of the website.

## Demo

You can watch the demo video of the NGO website I have included in my repository as `ngo website.mp4`
